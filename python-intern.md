# Python Developer Internship Task

Welcome! As part of our selection process for the **Python Developer Internship**, we invite you to complete the following technical challenge.

This task is designed to evaluate your ability to build a functional Python script, work with external APIs, structure your code properly, and follow modern development practices.

---

## Objective

Build a **command-line tool** in Python that allows users to **search for books by title** and fetch their details using a public API such as the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/).

---

## Requirements

Your script should:

- Prompt the user to input a **book title**
- Connect to a public book API and fetch data
- Display the following information:
  - **Title**
  - **Author(s)**
  - **Description**
  - **Published Date**
  - **Page Count**
- Handle:
  - No results
  - Network or API errors
  - Empty or invalid inputs
- Log all user searches and errors to a log file
- Use functions or classes to keep your code modular and readable

---

## Bonus Points (Optional, but appreciated)

You may optionally implement the following features for bonus credit:

- Add **unit tests** using `pytest` or similar
- Use a `.env` file to store API keys securely
- Provide a `Dockerfile` to containerize your app
- Include a `requirements.txt` for dependencies
- Allow repeated searches in one session (menu/loop)
- Write logs to `logs/app.log` with timestamp and log level
- Format terminal output nicely (e.g., using `tabulate`, `rich`, etc.)

---

## Submission Guidelines

Submit your solution in one of the following ways:

- **GitHub Repository** (preferred)
- Zipped folder via email or upload

Your submission must include:

- `book_lookup.py` (or main Python file)
- `README.md` explaining:
  - How to run your code
  - Your thought process and approach
  - What challenges you faced and how you solved them
  - Any resources or tools (e.g., StackOverflow, AI assistants, etc.)
- Any optional files: `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, `Dockerfile`, test files, etc.

---

## 💡 Evaluation Criteria

We’ll evaluate your submission based on:

| Criteria                | Weight |
|-------------------------|--------|
| Code correctness        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    |
| Modularity and clarity  | ⭐⭐⭐     |
| Error handling & logging| ⭐⭐      |
| Problem-solving approach| ⭐⭐      |
| Optional extras (Docker/tests/env) | ⭐⭐ |

Good luck! We look forward to seeing your solution.
